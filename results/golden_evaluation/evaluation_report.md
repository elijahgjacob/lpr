# Golden Dataset Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the evaluation results of the ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) system against our manually labeled golden dataset. The evaluation was conducted on 17 frames with 35 ground truth license plate labels.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Frames Evaluated**: 17 (frames 0, 100, 200, ..., 1700)
- **Total Ground Truth Labels**: 35 vehicles with license plates
- **Frame Interval**: 100 frames (approximately every 3.3 seconds at 30fps)
- **Video Source**: main_video.mp4 (highway traffic footage)

## Key Findings

### Overall Performance
- **Overall Accuracy**: 0.00% (0/35 correct detections)
- **Detection Rate**: 62.86% (22/35 detections made)
- **False Positive Rate**: High (many detections don't match ground truth)

### Detection Quality Breakdown
- **Exact Matches**: 0 (0.00%)
- **Partial Matches**: 20 (57.14%)
- **No Matches**: 15 (42.86%)

## Detailed Analysis

### What the Model Detected

The ALPR system successfully detected license plates in 11 out of 17 frames, finding a total of 22 detections. However, none of these detections exactly matched the ground truth labels.

#### Common Detection Patterns:
1. **"KHO5271"** - Detected in frames 200, 300
2. **"AK64DHV"** - Detected in frames 500, 600, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1600, 1700

### Issues Identified

#### 1. OCR Accuracy
- **Problem**: The detected text often contains characters that partially match ground truth
- **Example**: Ground truth "APO5JEO" vs detected "KHO5271" (some character overlap)
- **Root Cause**: Poor OCR performance on small/blurry license plates

#### 2. Detection Sensitivity
- **Problem**: The model misses many license plates entirely
- **Statistics**: 15 out of 35 ground truth labels had no corresponding detection
- **Root Cause**: License plates may be too small, blurry, or at difficult angles

#### 3. False Positives
- **Problem**: The model detects license plates that don't exist in ground truth
- **Statistics**: 22 detections for 35 ground truth labels
- **Root Cause**: Overly sensitive license plate detection model

## Frame-by-Frame Performance

| Frame | Ground Truth Labels | Detections | Status |
|-------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| 0 | 3 | 0 | Missed all |
| 100 | 3 | 0 | Missed all |
| 200 | 2 | 2 | Partial matches |
| 300 | 2 | 1 | Partial match |
| 400 | 4 | 0 | Missed all |
| 500 | 2 | 1 | Partial match |
| 600 | 3 | 1 | Partial match |
| 700 | 3 | 0 | Missed all |
| 800 | 1 | 4 | False positives |
| 900 | 3 | 3 | Mixed results |
| 1000 | 1 | 2 | False positives |
| 1100 | 1 | 2 | False positives |
| 1200 | 1 | 2 | False positives |
| 1300 | 2 | 0 | Missed all |
| 1400 | 2 | 1 | Partial match |
| 1600 | 2 | 1 | Partial match |
| 1700 | 1 | 2 | False positives |

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. OCR Enhancement
- **Preprocessing**: Improve image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy
- **Model Training**: Fine-tune OCR model on license plate-specific data
- **Text Validation**: Add post-processing rules for license plate format validation

### 2. Detection Tuning
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Adjust detection confidence thresholds to reduce false positives
- **Size Filtering**: Add minimum size requirements for license plate detection
- **Region of Interest**: Focus detection on vehicle regions to reduce background noise

### 3. Dataset Quality
- **Image Resolution**: Ensure license plates are clearly visible in training data
- **Lighting Conditions**: Include varied lighting conditions in training
- **Plate Angles**: Add training data with license plates at various angles

### 4. Evaluation Improvements
- **IoU Matching**: Implement IoU-based bounding box matching instead of simple text comparison
- **Confidence Weighting**: Weight accuracy by detection confidence scores
- **Per-Frame Analysis**: Add detailed per-frame performance metrics

## Technical Notes

### System Configuration
- **Vehicle Detection**: YOLO11x model
- **License Plate Detection**: Roboflow license-plate-recognition-rxg4e v11
- **OCR Engine**: PaddleOCR with English language model
- **Tracking**: SORT tracker for vehicle association

### Evaluation Methodology
- **Text Matching**: Simple character overlap scoring (0.0 = no match, 0.5 = partial, 1.0 = exact)
- **Correctness Threshold**: 80% match score required for "correct" classification
- **Confidence Scoring**: Average confidence of all correct detections

## Conclusion

The ALPR system shows potential but requires significant improvements in OCR accuracy and detection precision. The 57.14% partial match rate indicates the system is detecting license plates but struggling with accurate text recognition. Priority should be given to:

1. Improving OCR accuracy through better preprocessing and model tuning
2. Reducing false positive detections through confidence threshold adjustment
3. Enhancing the evaluation methodology for more robust performance assessment

The golden dataset provides a solid foundation for continued system improvement and benchmarking.
